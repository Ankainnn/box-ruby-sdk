Box Ruby Library
----------------

You can use the Box.net API to create applications and websites that integrate with Box.net and can perform the following functions:

* Store and retrieve files from Box.net
* Organize files into folders
* Move, rename and delete files
* Share files

### Usage ###

You must first obtain an API key by [registering your Box.net application](http://www.box.net/developers/services).

Once you have an API key, you are free to start using the box API! Check out the 'examples' folder for sample code and instructions.

### Documentation ###
